# Pre-work Study Guide Webpage

## Website


- I was motivated to make a career change!
- This project was built as part of an intoduction to coding!
- This program provides a basic study guide, along with console funtions to randomly tell a user which section to study
- I learned basic HTML to format a website at the ground level, CSS to add borders, colors, Javascript to allow users to open the dev tools to randomly select a study topic.
- I also learned how to use git hub to creat branches, work on the project, utilize push, pull and merge requests.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Usage

This website has notes for 4 topics, HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. These sections are basic notes for begginers. When viewing the webpage users can press (ctrl+shift+i) for windows, or (command+option+I) for MacOS to open the dev tools window on the console tab. Here a user can see the javascript running, listing all the topics of the study guide. Upon refreshing the page the javascript will randomly tell the user which topic to study.
